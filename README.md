# twitter_guessing_game
 
Welcome!

This personal project is a little game I made with Python and the Twitter API.

Currently, it will only work if you have a Twitter developer account and your own keys, but the code is here to showcase.

Objective:
Select the twitter account you wish to play, and try to guess which of the two tweets is an actual tweet by that account.
You have two lives, and must guess correctly three times to win.

Known Bugs:
- Sometimes the real tweet will either be incomplete, or .
